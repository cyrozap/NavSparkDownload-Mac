# NavSparkDownload-Mac

## Purpose
I wasn't able to compile the Linux source on my Mac as-is, so I made some modifications and published them to save others time.

## Installation
1. Install the most recent Xcode Command Line Tools for your version of Mac OS X [here](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) (you'll need to create a free Apple developer account if you don't have one already).
2. In a terminal, `cd` to the directory with the source code in it.
3. Run `make` to build the code and then (optionally) run `make install` to install the executable.
